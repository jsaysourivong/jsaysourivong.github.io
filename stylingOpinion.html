          I could imagine a scenario where too much CSS is applied. If styling is an important achievement regarding the goal of the page you're working on, then getting the styling right or making it appealing is worthwhile. Failing to make the page appealing could be a consequence of not using the right styling or using too much of the wrong styling and falling short of creating an appealing page or perhaps over complicating the styling causing it to feel overwhelming to a user. I don't think it's a bad practice to us inline CSS for smaller webpages but larger pages should probably include their CSS in a sperate file.

          I think there are instances of multiple CSS files being linked to an HTML file. The only example I can think of is by using frameworks frontend frameworks. Those frameworks will use their own CSS files to style your page but depending on the structure of your project you could add your own CSS to individual pages or even a CSS file for the shared pages.

          Based of articles telling me javascript is a actually a very in demand language I would imagine advance websites are still using html, css, and javascript. I think to achieve some of those fancy aspects you need to have creative developers who are using CSS and HTML at an expert level.

          I think HTML is increasingly more complex as it get's larger. Having to rely on what did or didn't happen after a change was made in the HTML file is finicky business. It requires a great degree of knowledge from the developer to quickly troubleshoot issues.
